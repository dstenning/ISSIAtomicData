# ISSIAtomicData

The goal here is to compute different realizations of the CHIANTI atomic data for use in
interpreting observed density sensitive line ratios. Here is a description of the current
directories:

* phase2_20161006 -> Latest versions of emissivities and intensities for CfA meeting

older stuff:

* atomic_data_v1_hpw -> HPW's calculations with uniform uncertainties
* atomic_data_v2_gdz -> GDZ's calculations with non-uniform uncertainties (current)
* chianti_errors_fe_13 -> GDZ's work on Fe XIII
* chianti_errors_o_7 -> GDZ and CB's work on O VII
* data/HinodeAnalysisGDZ_v1 -> The analysis of EIS Fe XIII spectra with GDZ atomic data (current)
* data/HinodeAnalysisHPW_v1 -> Older analysis with HPW atomic data
* TestR -> A test R script for reading various files
